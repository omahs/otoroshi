### Running an simple OAuth 1 server

In this tutorial, we'll instantiate a oauth 1 server with docker. If you alredy have the necessary, skip this section @ref:[to](#create-an-oauth-1-provider-module).

Let's start by running the server

```sh
docker run -d --name oauth1-server --rm \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -e OAUTH1_CLIENT_ID=2NVVBip7I5kfl0TwVmGzTphhC98kmXScpZaoz7ET \
    -e OAUTH1_CLIENT_SECRET=wXzb8tGqXNbBQ5juA0ZKuFAmSW7RwOw8uSbdE3MvbrI8wjcbGp \
    -e OAUTH1_REDIRECT_URI=http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/backoffice/auth0/callback \
    ghcr.io/beryju/oauth1-test-server
```

We created a oauth 1 server which accepts `http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/backoffice/auth0/callback` as `Redirect URI`. This URL is used by Otoroshi to retrieve a token and a profile at the end of an authentication process.

After this command, the container logs should output :
```sh 
127.0.0.1 - - [14/Oct/2021 12:10:49] "HEAD /api/health HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

### Create an OAuth 1 provider module

1. Go ahead, and navigate to @link:[http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080](http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080) { open=new }
1. Click on the cog icon on the top right
1. Then **Authentication configs** button
1. And add a new configuration when clicking on the **Add item** button
2. Select the `Oauth1 provider` in the type selector field
3. Set a basic name and description like `oauth1-provider`
4. Set `2NVVBip7I5kfl0TwVmGzTphhC98kmXScpZaoz7ET` as `Consumer key`
5. Set `wXzb8tGqXNbBQ5juA0ZKuFAmSW7RwOw8uSbdE3MvbrI8wjcbGp` as `Consumer secret`
6. Set `http://localhost:5000/oauth/request_token` as `Request Token URL`
7. Set `http://localhost:5000/oauth/authorize` as `Authorize URL`
8. Set `http://localhost:oauth/access_token` as `Access token URL`
9. Set `http://localhost:5000/api/me` as `Profile URL`
10. Set `http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/backoffice/auth0/callback` as `Callback URL`
11. At the bottom of the page, disable the **secure** button (because we're using http and this configuration avoid to include cookie in an HTTP Request without secure channel, typically HTTPs)

 At this point, your configuration should be similar to :

<!-- oto-scenario
 - goto /bo/dashboard/auth-configs/edit/auth_mod_oauth1.0_provider
 - wait 1000
 - screenshot generated-hows-to-secure-with-oauth1-provider.png
-->
<img src="../imgs/generated-hows-to-secure-with-oauth1-provider.png" />

With this configuration, the connected user will receive default access on teams and organizations. If you want to change the access rights for a specific user, you can achieve it with the `Rights override` field and a configuration like :

```json
{
  "foo@example.com": [
    {
      "tenant": "*:rw",
      "teams": [
        "*:rw"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Save your configuration at the bottom of the page, then navigate to the `danger zone` to use your module as a third-party connection to the Otoroshi UI.

### Connect to Otoroshi with OAuth1 authentication

To secure Otoroshi with your OAuth1 configuration, we have to register an Authentication configuration as a BackOffice Auth. configuration.

1. Navigate to the **danger zone** (when clicking on the cog on the top right and selecting Danger zone)
1. Scroll to the **BackOffice auth. settings**
1. Select your last Authentication configuration (created in the previous section)
1. Save the global configuration with the button on the top right

### Testing your configuration

1. Disconnect from your instance
1. Then click on the **Login using third-party** button (or navigate to http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080)
2. Click on **Login using Third-party** button
3. If all is configured, Otoroshi will redirect you to the oauth 1 server login page
4. Set `example-user` as user and trust the user by clicking on `yes` button.
5. Good work! You're connected to Otoroshi with an OAuth1 module.

> A fallback solution is always available in the event of a bad authentication configuration. By going to http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/bo/simple/login, the administrators will be able to redefine the configuration.

### Secure an app with OAuth 1 authentication

With the previous configuration, you can secure any of Otoroshi services with it. 

The first step is to apply a little change on the previous configuration. 

1. Navigate to @link:[http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/bo/dashboard/auth-configs](http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/bo/dashboard/auth-configs) { open=new }.
2. Create a new auth module configuration with the same values.
3. Replace the `Callback URL` field to `http://privateapps.oto.tools:8080/privateapps/generic/callback` (we changed this value because the redirection of a logged user by a third-party server is cover by an other route by Otoroshi).
4. Disable the `secure` button (because we're using http and this configuration avoid to include cookie in an HTTP Request without secure channel, typically HTTPs)

> Note : an Otoroshi service is called a private app when it is protected by an authentication module.

Our example server supports only one redirect URI. We need to kill it, and to create a new container with `http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/privateapps/generic/callback` as `OAUTH1_REDIRECT_URI`

```sh
docker rm -f oauth1-server
docker run -d --name oauth1-server --rm \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -e OAUTH1_CLIENT_ID=2NVVBip7I5kfl0TwVmGzTphhC98kmXScpZaoz7ET \
    -e OAUTH1_CLIENT_SECRET=wXzb8tGqXNbBQ5juA0ZKuFAmSW7RwOw8uSbdE3MvbrI8wjcbGp \
    -e OAUTH1_REDIRECT_URI=http://privateapps.oto.tools:8080/privateapps/generic/callback \
    ghcr.io/beryju/oauth1-test-server
```

Once the authentication module and the new container created, we can define the authentication module on the service.

1. Navigate to any created route
2. Search in the list of plugins the plugin named `Authentication`
3. Select your Authentication config inside the list
4. Don't forget to save your configuration.

Now you can try to call your route and see the login module appears.

The allow access to the user.

If you had any errors, make sure of :

* check if you are on http or https, and if the **secure cookie option** is enabled or not on the authentication module
* check if your OAuth1 server has the REDIRECT_URI set on **privateapps/...**
* Make sure your server supports POST or GET OAuth1 flow set on authentication module

Once the configuration is working, you can check, when connecting with an Otoroshi admin user, the `Private App session` created (use the cog at the top right of the page, and select `Priv. app sesssions`, or navigate to @link:[http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/bo/dashboard/sessions/private](http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/bo/dashboard/sessions/private) { open=new }).

One interesing feature is to check the profile of the connected user. In our case, when clicking on the `Profile` button of the right user, we should have : 

```json
{
  "email": "foo@example.com",
  "id": 1,
  "name": "test name",
  "screen_name": "example-user"
}
```
